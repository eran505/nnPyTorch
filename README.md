# pyTorch

check if correlation between the inputs features are good or bad -> A-D feature

train on the final policy (online)
when the data is -> state,action = val 


after training check what the neural network policy achieved, meaning-full policy or just randomize


impl a counter near each state (?)

maybe insert time feature
